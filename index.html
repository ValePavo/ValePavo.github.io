              </div>
              <p>
                As a Gameplay Programmer at Taco Studios, I developed core
                systems and mechanics for several titles, including two with
                Web3 and blockchain integration, and one designed for VR.
                Working on resource-constrained devices taught me to prioritize
                performance optimization and efficient resource management for
                non high-end hardware. As a Multiplayer Programmer, I
                architected secure, server-authoritative solutions with Web3
                integration, always maintaining a strong focus on delivering a
                smooth and seamless gameplay experience.

              <p>
                During my tenure at Rainstones, I served as CTO and was
                instrumental in architecting mission-critical software projects,
                with a primary focus on mobile AR solutions for the education,
                commerce, and advertising sectors. I was responsible for
                designing scalable, efficient systems and providing technical
                leadership to a cross-functional team.

                During my time at JLab as Founder and CTO, I grew not only
                technically but also as the leader of a small technical team. I
                learned to manage projects and team deadlines, and—most
                importantly—how to create a work environment that was both
                efficient and enjoyable, resulting in high productivity. I was
                able to approach and develop the entire workflow, from ideation
                and design to both frontend and backend development, with a
                strong focus on creating AR solutions.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Game Developer with over 8 years of experience using Unity and
          nearly 4 years working professionally in the video game industry.
          Throughout my career, I have contributed to a wide range of projects,
          developing gameplay mechanics, save systems, and various types of
          inventory systems, as well as working on multiplayer architectures and
          immersive VR experiences. I have collaborated closely with multiple
          departments, taking on both technical and coordination
          responsibilities, including acting as a project lead when needed. Over
          the years, I have developed a solid understanding of shading and VFX,
          and my work with VR devices has strengthened my focus on performance
          optimization, particularly for non–high-end hardware. I am passionate
          about building scalable, well-structured systems and delivering
          high-quality experiences while maintaining strong performance across
          platforms
